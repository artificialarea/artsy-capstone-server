# Capstone: Artsy (API)
'Artsy' is an application in which sharing art with your friends and followers is easier than ever. Each user has their own profile containing a timeline of everything they have posted, liked, shared and specific collections theyâ€™ve created. They also have their own dashboard feed which shows all of the art posted by the people they follow in chronological order. We want the user to interact with posts by commenting, liking, and sharing!

## Development Roadmap (to do later)
This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:
* Personalized avatar image for profile
* Liking a post (only to save it to your profile, not public)
* Re-posting someone else's post
* Pagnination of posts in a feed via an "infinity scroll" mechanic
* Deletion of images stored in the Cloudinary database thru our server
* More compelling non-signed experience, especially on the landing page
